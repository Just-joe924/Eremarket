# EreMarket — Setup

Full-stack marketplace: **Vite + React + TS + Tailwind** (client), **Express + TS** (server), **Supabase** (DB/Auth), **Paystack** (NGN payments), **Resend** (email).

## Prerequisites
- Node 20+ and npm 10+
- A Supabase project (target: `ivwdfxjvnexqsrqwnkoy`)
- A Paystack account (for online payments)
- A Resend account (for receipts and contact-form email)

## 1. Install
```bash
npm install            # installs all workspaces (client + server)
```

## 2. Environment
Copy each example file and fill in values from Supabase → **Project Settings → API**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env                 # root: SUPABASE_URL + SERVICE_ROLE key (seed only)
cp client/.env.example client/.env   # VITE_SUPABASE_URL + ANON key
cp server/.env.example server/.env   # server keys
```
- **anon/public key** → browser (client). Safe to ship; protected by RLS.
- **service-role key** → root `.env` (seed) and `server/.env` only. **Secret.**

## 3. Database schema
Apply the migrations **in order**, either:
- **Dashboard:** SQL Editor → paste each file → Run, or
- **CLI:** `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` then `supabase db push`.

1. `0001_init.sql` — tables, auto-profile trigger, RLS policies.
2. `0002_fix_profile_trigger.sql` — makes `profiles.full_name` nullable and the
   signup trigger null-safe.
3. `0003_marketplace.sql` — sellers, seller-owned products, image galleries.
4. `0004_seller_role.sql` · `0005_sizes_and_fulfillment.sql` · `0006_promote_admin.sql` · `0007_reviews.sql`
5. `0008_localisation.sql` — **⚠️ deletes the DummyJSON demo catalogue.** Adds
   seller shop address + contact columns, and order payment columns
   (`payment_method`, `fulfilment`, `payment_reference`).

> `0008` removes every product with no `seller_id` — that is exactly the demo
> data seeded in step 4. Real seller listings are untouched. Skip this migration
> if you want to keep the demo products.

## 4. Seed products (dev only)
```bash
npm run seed           # imports ~100 products from DummyJSON into the DB
```
Skip this for a real launch — `0008_localisation.sql` deletes whatever it adds.
Prices are treated as **naira**, so seeded values (9.99, 249.99…) look wrong;
add real products through the seller dashboard instead.

## 5. Run
```bash
npm run dev            # client (5173) + server (4000) together
# or individually:
npm run dev:client
npm run dev:server
```

## Workspace layout
```
client/    Vite + React + TS + Tailwind frontend
server/    Express + TS API (orders, payments, contact, seller, admin)
supabase/  migrations/ + seed/
legacy/    original static HTML/CSS site (reference only)
```

## 6. Payments — Paystack

EreMarket charges in **naira**. Paystack is used rather than Stripe because Stripe
does not onboard Nigerian businesses. Without a key, `POST /api/checkout/session`
returns `501` and online payment is disabled — **pay-on-pickup still works**.

1. Paystack Dashboard → **Settings → API Keys & Webhooks**. Copy the *secret*
   key into `server/.env`:
   ```
   PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...      # sk_live_... once your business is approved
   ```
2. On the same page, set the **webhook URL** to your deployed API:
   ```
   https://YOUR_API_HOST/api/webhooks/paystack
   ```
   Paystack cannot reach `localhost`, so no webhook fires in local dev. That's
   fine: the success page also verifies and fulfills via
   `GET /api/checkout/verify?reference=…`, so orders finalize either way.

**Flow:** `POST /api/checkout/session` creates a **pending** order, stamps a
`payment_reference` on it, and opens a Paystack transaction → the buyer is
redirected to Paystack → on success the webhook (or the verify endpoint) runs
the idempotent `markOrderPaid()` — decrement stock, clear cart, set `paid`, email
the receipt. Both paths check that the amount collected covers the order total
before fulfilling.

**Test cards:** Paystack test mode accepts `4084 0840 8408 4081`
(any future expiry, CVV `408`, PIN `0000`, OTP `123456`).

### Pay on pickup
Buyers who choose *pick up at the shop* can select **pay on pickup**. That path
skips Paystack entirely: `POST /api/orders` reserves the order (stock is
decremented, cart cleared), leaves it `pending`, and emails a receipt showing the
amount due and the shop address. The seller marks the item `delivered` when the
buyer collects and pays.

## 7. Email — Resend

Receipts, fulfillment updates and contact-form messages all go through Resend.
With `RESEND_API_KEY` unset, sends are skipped and logged — nothing breaks.

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
EMAIL_FROM=EreMarket <hello@eremarket.store>   # must be a verified sender/domain
CONTACT_EMAIL_TO=you@eremarket.store           # where contact-form messages land
LOGO_URL=https://www.eremarket.store/assets/brand/logo-eremarket-on-teal.png
```

`onboarding@resend.dev` works for early testing but only delivers to your own
Resend account email — verify a domain to reach anyone else. `LOGO_URL` defaults
to `CLIENT_ORIGIN/assets/brand/logo-eremarket-on-teal.png`; a `localhost` value
renders as a broken image in real inboxes, so set it explicitly once deployed.

```bash
npm run test:email -w server -- you@example.com   # end-to-end send check
npm run preview:email -w server                   # render every email to HTML, no sending
```

`preview:email` writes `server/.email-preview/*.html` — open them in a browser
to check the design without placing an order.

## 8. Domain cutover — caraecom.store → eremarket.store

Do these **in order**. The ordering matters: `CLIENT_ORIGIN` is the single
allowed CORS origin (`server/src/index.ts`), so flipping it before the new
domain resolves will break the live site.

Pick **one** canonical host first and use it everywhere below. These examples
use `https://www.eremarket.store`. `https://eremarket.store` and
`https://www.eremarket.store` are *different origins* to CORS — mixing them is
the most common way this goes wrong.

**1. Vercel — add the domain**
- Project → Settings → Domains → add both `eremarket.store` and
  `www.eremarket.store`; mark the canonical one Primary. Vercel 308-redirects
  the other, so visitors always end up on the canonical origin.
- Keep `caraecom.store` attached and redirect it to the new domain. Do **not**
  delete it until traffic and links have moved — see the CORS note below.
- Wait for DNS + the TLS certificate to go green before step 2.

**2. Render (API) — environment**
| Variable | New value |
|---|---|
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | `https://www.eremarket.store` |
| `LOGO_URL` | `https://www.eremarket.store/assets/brand/logo-eremarket-on-teal.png` |

`CLIENT_ORIGIN` also drives the Paystack callback URL and every link in the
transactional emails, so this one variable moves three things at once.

> **CORS cutover:** the moment `CLIENT_ORIGIN` changes, anyone still sitting on
> `caraecom.store` gets blocked on every API call. The Vercel redirect in step 1
> prevents that — it moves the browser to the new origin before any request is
> made. If you want a grace period where *both* origins work, `cors({ origin: … })`
> accepts an array; that is a small code change, not an env change.

**3. Supabase — auth redirect URLs**
`signUp` (`client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) passes no `emailRedirectTo`, so
confirmation and recovery links use the dashboard setting:
- Authentication → URL Configuration → **Site URL** = `https://www.eremarket.store`
- Add it to **Redirect URLs** too; keep the old domain listed until old links expire.

Renaming the Supabase **project** in the dashboard is cosmetic and safe. The
project *ref* is baked into `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and the keys — never change it.
Do not rename tables or columns.

**4. Paystack**
- Settings → API Keys & Webhooks → webhook URL stays the Render host:
  `https://YOUR_API_HOST/api/webhooks/paystack`. It only changes if you move the
  API to a custom subdomain.
- If your account has a callback-URL allowlist, add `https://www.eremarket.store/checkout/success`.

**5. Resend — outbound (sending) domain**

Add the **apex** `eremarket.store` in Resend → Domains → Add Domain, and keep the
same region as the existing domain (`eu-west-1`) so the records match. Resend
scopes its own SPF to a `send.` subdomain automatically, which is what keeps it
from colliding with ImprovMX on the apex — you do **not** add a subdomain by hand.

Resend then shows three records. Add them in Vercel → Domains → `eremarket.store`
→ DNS Records:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| MX | `send` (priority 10) | `feedback-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonses.com` |
| TXT | `send` | `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` |
| TXT | `resend._domainkey` | the `p=…` key **Resend generates for this domain** |

> Vercel's **Name** field is relative to the domain — enter `send`, not
> `send.eremarket.store`, or you end up with `send.eremarket.store.eremarket.store`.
> The DKIM key is per-domain: copy the one Resend shows you, never the old domain's.

Click **Verify** in Resend, then set `EMAIL_FROM=EreMarket <hello@eremarket.store>`
on Render. Leave `caraecom.store` verified in Resend until nothing sends from it.

**6. ImprovMX — inbound forwarding**

Add on the **apex**, in the same Vercel DNS screen:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| MX | `@` (priority 10) | `mx1.improvmx.com` |
| MX | `@` (priority 20) | `mx2.improvmx.com` |
| TXT | `@` | `v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all` |

Then create the aliases in ImprovMX (`hello`, `support` — the local part only;
the field appends the domain) pointing at your real inbox, and set
`CONTACT_EMAIL_TO` on Render to whichever one should receive contact-form
messages. Avoid making it the same address as `EMAIL_FROM`; sending from and to
one address trips loop detection on some filters.

> **ImprovMX free tier allows one domain**, so `eremarket.store` cannot be added
> while `caraecom.store` still occupies the slot. Don't swap early — do it in the
> same sitting as the `EMAIL_FROM` flip in step 5: delete the old domain, add the
> new one, recreate the aliases. The MX records are already live by then, so it
> goes Active immediately. Until that moment, point `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO` at a plain
> mailbox (e.g. your Gmail) so inbound forwarding is never on the critical path.
> Premium ($9/m) lifts the limit and adds SMTP credentials, which is the only way
> to make Gmail "Send As" reply from `hello@eremarket.store`.

> A domain may have only **one** SPF TXT record on a given name. The apex SPF is
> ImprovMX's alone — never add `include:amazonses.com` to it. Outbound SPF lives
> on `send.` (step 5) and the two never meet.

Optional but worth it: neither domain has a DMARC record. Add
TXT `_dmarc` → `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@eremarket.store` once the above
verifies. `p=none` only reports, it rejects nothing, and it helps deliverability
under Gmail's bulk-sender rules.

**7. This repo**
- `client/index.html` — point `og:url` and `og:image` at the new domain.
- Redeploy the client. `VITE_API_URL` is inlined at **build** time, so editing it
  in Vercel without a redeploy changes nothing.

**8. Verify**
```bash
curl -I https://www.eremarket.store                      # 200
curl -I https://caraecom.store                           # 308 → new domain
curl -I https://www.eremarket.store/assets/brand/logo-eremarket-on-teal.png
curl -s https://YOUR_API_HOST/health                     # {"status":"ok",…}
npm run test:email -w server -- you@example.com          # logo + links resolve
```
Then place a real low-value order end to end and confirm the receipt.

**9. Clean-up, once the above is verified**
- Delete `client/public/img/logo.png` — it only exists so a stale `LOGO_URL`
  still renders the EreMarket mark.
- Two deliberate `cara` strings remain and are safe to leave:
  `GUEST_KEY = 'cara-cart-guest'` (`client/src/context/CartContext.tsx`) — renaming
  empties every guest cart once — and `service: 'cara-api'` in `/health`, which is
  an API response field, not UI.
