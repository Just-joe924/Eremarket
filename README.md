# EreMarket — Marketplace (full-stack)

A full-stack marketplace where sellers open a storefront and buyers shop across
every store. Evolved from the original static HTML/CSS Cara template, since rebranded
to EreMarket for local retail around Ojodu, Lagos.

Prices are in **naira**. Buyers pay online through Paystack (card, bank transfer,
USSD) or reserve an order and pay the seller when they collect it in person.

**Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + **Tailwind** (client) · Express + TypeScript (server) · **Supabase** (Postgres/Auth/RLS) · **Paystack** (NGN payments) · **Resend** (email).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install      # installs the client + server workspaces
npm run dev      # runs client (5173) and server (4000) together
```

See **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** for environment variables, applying the database schema, and seeding products.
